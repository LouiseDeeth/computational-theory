    "- **Why big-endian format:** SHA-256 uses big-endian so all computers process data the same way.\n",

    "The following are the SHA-256 hashes of three common passwords that have been hashed using one pass of the SHA-256 algorithm. As strings, they were encoded using UTF-8. Determine the passwords and explain how you found them. Suggest ways in which the hashing of passwords could be improved to prevent the kind of attack you performed to find the passwords.\n",
